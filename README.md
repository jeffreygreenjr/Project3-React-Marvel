# PROJECT 3 
# MARVEL REACT APP

## Description
In the eigth week of my Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp, I developed and deployed a modular and modern front-end application using React. If you're someone like me, uneducated in the comic world, use this application as a tool to educate yourself. In this React app build, you'll be able to interact with a third-party API fetching results for all things related to Marvel (characters, comics, creators, etc). On the go? Heading to see the newest Marvel Studios film? Don't you worry, I've implemented responsive design so this application is mobile-friendly.

To browse this application, please click on this link:
https://jeffreygreen-marvel-react-api.netlify.app
You will be loaded into the landing page. "Explore Marvel Universe" by clicking into the title text, the choose your destiny by clicking the Character or Comics page. From there, you are prompted with a search engine as well as an alphabetical list of all the characters/comics results. Click on one of the options to learn more information. The Marvel Universe expands far and wide, so dig deep!

#### Next Steps/Future Enhancements
The possibilities are endless when it comes to this API, there is so much data to be retreived! Moving forward, I'd like to continue fetching information in attempt to build the most informative Marvel application possible. In alignment with the Marvel Studios brand, there are definitely some fun design opportunities to spice things up. The further I get in my software engineering/web development journey, the more additions I'll be able to make as I am constantly learning new things!
